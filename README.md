**Reported by `The Mayor` on `TODO`**

Dear citizens of `term-world`, it is I, your Mayor. Having heard your deepest wants
and needs, having listened to you for so long, understanding -- even if in a somewhat
distanced way (you are merely the _people_ after all) -- what it is that you most 
desire, the time has come to let you use some of your power (however meagre) to effect
the changes you wish to see in our fair city. That is right, my citizens, I have heard
you, and you want to _work_.

And _work_, you must! As one of my trusted mentors in all things political once said,
> nothing good ever comes.
So there's nothing to look forward to except the glow, the sheen, the aura of the work 
that you will complete for that same nothing.

However, I allow that perhaps some things in `term-world` don't work exactly the way
that you want them to. For example, our power system, while splendid for _me_, may
not perform the same for you. Our world's `inventory` might not seem to function
"correctly," as one with a critical eye _might_ say.

## Overview

At this point, the world (to a somewhat controlled extent) is yours. The task for 
the remainder of your time in `term-world` is a grand improvement, one that 
synthesizes everything you've gained over the course of the semester. This is 
an open-ended task that can be completed individually or in "partnerships" 
(groups which can span neighborhoods). 

While there are rules to this task, they are fewer than a traditional assignment, 
though the work is much larger.

## Completing `project` content

### Partnerships

All citizens must engage in a partnership with at least `1` other citizen. These
partnerships can be made without neighborhood membership in mind.

Partnerships (i.e. self-selected groups) cannot be larger than `3` citizens. 
There will be no accommodations to this rule.

### Choosing a project

World projects are necessarily open. This means that you're able to select 
anything to work on, though the project will need to be of sufficient 
complexity and depth to warrant needing 3+ weeks for completion. The only area 
out-right forbidden in `term-world`: games. We need not of trifles, amusements, 
or diversions. We are building a world, after all.

#### Examples

Scale and scope (i.e. how much work and how much is affected by that work) will 
vary from project to project. As long as the difficulty and duration are 
appropriate to the individual(s) completing the work, this is not a factor in 
evaluation. No one gets "more points" by doing something harder, though all of 
yoru projects will challenge you.

For your consideration, the Office of the Mayor provides the following short 
list of potential projects, some of which may already be spoken for:

* a community power grid
* a world wallet system
* a world economy
* improvements to the inventory system
* proper vending machines
* citizen transportation

These examples do not contemplate the entire range of possibilities. There are 
many more for you to discover. Only one project can address a given specific 
area. The Mayor will collect projects that citizens suggest and approve them on 
a case-by-case basis.

### Work

There are various dates for documentation, demonstration, and final submission. 
Refer to the table below for these dates which are _hard deadlines_. Unless 
truly extenuating circumstances exist, these dates cannot be abridged.

|Work due              |Date                  |
|:---------------------|:---------------------|
|Proposal              |21 November 2022      |
|Progress Report       |2 December 2022       |
|Project Demonstration          |9 December 2022       |
|Final Report          |12:00p, 20 December 2022 |
|Final Project Code    |12:00p, 20 December 2022 |

### Proposal

This project starts by writing a clear proposal of the work you expect to 
complete over the course of this extended project. This work must be completed 

Final project code has one Golden Rule and many supporting rules of lesser 
metallic lustre. Not to bury the lede, the Golden Rule:

> The project code must run and achieve its intended task.

Of course, supporting this, the code must:

* Be coordinated using a `main.py` file in the `src` directory
* Use at least `3` self-written `module` files `import`ed across the range of 
included code
  * i.e. they don't have to all be in the `main.py`
* Use at least `1` `module` that we haven't studied at all this semester
  * you may need to install a package to use it; consult with course 
administrative staff to complete
  * there are already many on the server(s)
* Use at least one of each data structure:
  * `dictionary`
  * `list`
* Use at least 5 `function`s across the range of code provided

The above is not an exhaustive list of what code should contain in order to 
complete its job. In fact, it's highly unlikely that the above will be _all you 
need_.

## Backup Policy Reminder

**While we may use this server to store code, you are responsible for using 
GitHub as your main backup.**

In the event that the `term-world` server goes down for any unforeseen reason, 
your work may be lost. Though this server is backed up on a regular (i.e. 
weekly) basis, there is no guarantee that up-to-the-minute data for your work 
will be restored.

Remember: to err is human; to back up your work is *divine*.
