**Reported by `The Mayor` on `TODO`**

Dear citizens of `term-world`, it is I, your Mayor. Having heard your deepest wants
and needs, having listened to you for so long, understanding -- even if in a somewhat
distanced way (you are merely the _people_ after all) -- what it is that you most 
desire, the time has come to let you use some of your power (however meagre) to effect
the changes you wish to see in our fair city. That is right, my citizens, I have heard
you, and you want to _work_.

And _work_ you must! As one of my trusted mentors in all things political once said,

> nothing good ever comes.

So there's nothing to look forward to except the glow, the sheen, the aura of the work 
that you will complete for that very same nothing.

However, I allow that perhaps some things in `term-world` don't work exactly the way
that you want them to. For example, our power system, while splendid for _me_, may
not perform the same for you. Our world's `inventory` might not seem to function
"correctly," as one with a critical eye _might_ say. I've heard discussions of a, 
"mass transit" system, which is something my advisors tell me that I wouldn't like
because the word "mass" means more than just _me_.

So begin your planning! Decipher the many systems that the world offers you! Propose
whatever it is that you've been telling me that you want (and you'll need to propose it
because, frankly, I've forgotten everything anyone has suggested to me). Let's get to 
work people! We have a new status quo to build, uphold, and leverage for _my gain_!

## Overview

At this point, the world (to a somewhat controlled extent) is yours. The task for 
the remainder of your time in `term-world` is a grand improvement, one that 
synthesizes everything you've gained over the course of the semester. This is 
an open-ended task that can be completed individually or in "partnerships" 
(groups which can span neighborhoods). 

While there are rules to this task, they are fewer than a traditional assignment, 
though the work is much larger.

## Completing `project` content

### Partnerships

All citizens must engage in a partnership with at least `1` other citizen. These
partnerships can be made without neighborhood membership in mind.

Partnerships (i.e. self-selected groups) cannot be larger than `3` citizens. 
There will be no accommodations to this rule.

### Choosing a project

World tasks are determined by the areas of work indicated below. Each partership
will be offered a rank-choice vote to choose areas in which they'd like to work.

#### Areas of work

Below, you'll find broad descriptions  of the various areas and their relative complexity. 
You may use this chart to determine which projects are of interest and appropriate scope.

##### `term-world` power grid

`term-world` possesses natural resources, but no systematic way to distribute them! While
we've seen a proof of concept for power plants, the halcyon days of everyone getting as
much power as they need won't last forever. To keep our world sustainable, someone has to
come up with a fair model. This involves any of the following (and/or more!):

- [ ] Limiting the amount of power allocated to a user's various objects
- [ ] Using power from renewable sources before accessing the limited exhaustible pool
- [ ] Potentially developing new resources (exhaustible and not) to feed power demand
- [ ] Using a limited amount of space to allocate creation of plants, panels, or turbines

##### `term-world` transportation

`cd`ing around only gets us so far. Have you ever imagined what it would look like if we could,
for example, go straight from `Galbee` to `Arago`? This contemplates things like
busses, rail, or even ride sharing. However, that doesn't exist in `term-world` as of yet. Could
you be the one to bring these services? This might include:

- [ ] Timed, scheduled transportation opportunities and predetermined routes
- [ ] A `train-station`, `bus-station` or other project that displays schedules worldwide
- [ ] The ability to use these stations as a way to move between locations seamlessly
- [ ] On-demand transport from place to place (with a cost?)

##### `term-world` financial system

The fate of partnerships rise and fall with the level of investment of time and resources in 
`term-world` -- the great capital cycle. Money makes the world go 'round -- of that we can be
sure. Of course, no capital system exists without the reward of...PROFITS!
Your task, should you take on this project is to create a market system that allows `term-world`
citizens to partake in the riches and risks of _investments_. This could:

- [ ] account for the value of a given partnership's rate of development to assess a value
- [ ] create and offer investments in many of `term-world`'s fictitious corporate entites
- [ ] assess a economic value of `term-world` and fix a currency to the gross digital product (GDP)
- [ ] contemplate a savings and loan system for residents to invest their hard-earned/ill-gotten gains

##### `term-world` snacks and concessions

No nutritional value to be found here, folks. However, value comes in many shapes, sizes, and flavors!
If you accept this assignment, your task is two-fold: developing a suite of products that appeal to fellow
citizens _and_ creating a distribution system for them via world vending machines. Here you might have to:

- [ ] create a centralized list of products to stock vending machines
- [ ] draw from the above list to present options to citizens, and
- [ ] determine the quantities and availabilities of various products (e.g. some can sell out?)
- [ ] provide a vending machine object in every neighborhood to adequately promote your product
- [ ] engage in an aggressive advertising campaign

##### `term-world` inventory

`term-world` has a robust sense of property management. Despite this, there are certainly ways in
which it can be extended and improved. Here, you'll need to consult the current `inventory` system
to make improvemnets. This requires reading through a code base, but also working within the "rules"
and assumptions made by it. Some examples of features on request:

- [ ] `backpacks` which can increase the amount of digital "stuff" a citizen can carry
- [ ] mystery boxes which act like presents: users receiving the boxes don't know what they will get!
- [ ] the ability to propose and execute trades with other users


### Completing project work

There are various dates for documentation, demonstration, and final submission. 
Refer to the table below for these dates which are _hard deadlines_. Unless 
truly extenuating circumstances exist, these dates cannot be abridged.

|Work due              |Date                  |

|Proposal              |`TODO`       |

|Final Report          |12:00p, `TODO` |
|Final Project Code    |12:00p, `TODO` |
|Final Project Presentation |`TODO`    |

#### Proposal

This project starts with your writing a clear proposal of the work you expect to 
complete over the course of this extended project. Areas to address are located
in the [docs/progress.md](docs/progress.md) file located in this repository.

Final project code has one Golden Rule and many supporting rules of lesser 
metallic lustre. Not to bury the lede, the Golden Rule:

> The project code must run and achieve its intended task.

Of course, supporting this, the code must:

* Be coordinated using a `main.py` file in the `src` directory
* Use at least `3` self-written `module` files `import`ed across the range of 
included code
  * i.e. they don't have to all be in the `main.py`
* Use at least `1` `module` that we haven't studied at all this semester
  * you may need to install a package to use it; consult with course 
administrative staff to complete
  * there are already many on the server(s)
* Use at least one of each data structure:
  * `dictionary`
  * `list`
* Use at least 5 `function`s across the range of code provided

The above is not an exhaustive list of what code should contain in order to 
complete its job. In fact, it's highly unlikely that the above will be _all you 
need_.

## Backup Policy Reminder

**While we may use this server to store code, you are responsible for using 
GitHub as your main backup.**

In the event that the `term-world` server goes down for any unforeseen reason, 
your work may be lost. Though this server is backed up on a regular (i.e. 
weekly) basis, there is no guarantee that up-to-the-minute data for your work 
will be restored.

Remember: to err is human; to back up your work is *divine*.
