**Reported by `The Mayor` on `TODO`**

Dear citizens of `term-world`, it is I, your Mayor. Having heard your deepest 
wants
and needs, having listened to you for so long, understanding -- even if in a 
somewhat
distanced way (you are merely the _people_ after all) -- what it is that you 
most 
desire, the time has come to let you use some of your power (however meagre) to 
effect
the changes you wish to see in our fair city. That is right, my citizens, I 
have heard
you, and you want to _work_.

And _work_ you must! As one of my trusted mentors in all things political once 
said,

> nothing good ever comes.

So there's nothing to look forward to except the glow, the sheen, the aura of 
the work 
that you will complete for that very same nothing.

However, I allow that perhaps some things in `term-world` don't work exactly 
the way
that you want them to. For example, our power system, while splendid for _me_, 
may
not perform the same for you. Our world's `inventory` might not seem to function
"correctly," as one with a critical eye _might_ say. I've heard discussions of 
a, 
"mass transit" system, which is something my advisors tell me that I wouldn't 
like
because the word "mass" means more than just _me_.

So begin your planning! Decipher the many systems that the world offers you! 
Propose
whatever it is that you've been telling me that you want (and you'll need to 
propose it
because, frankly, I've forgotten everything anyone has suggested to me). Let's 
get to 
work people! We have a new status quo to build, uphold, and leverage for _my 
gain_!

## Overview

At this point, the world (to a somewhat controlled extent) is yours. The task 
for 
the remainder of your time in `term-world` is a grand improvement, one that 
synthesizes everything you've gained over the course of the semester. This is 
an open-ended task that can be completed individually or in "partnerships" 
(groups which can span neighborhoods). 

While there are rules to this task, they are fewer than a traditional 
assignment, 
though the work is much larger.

## Completing `project` content

### Partnerships

All citizens must engage in a partnership with at least `1` other citizen. These
partnerships can be made without neighborhood membership in mind.

Partnerships (i.e. self-selected groups) cannot be larger than `3` citizens. 
There will be no accommodations to this rule.

### Choosing a project

World tasks are determined by the areas of work indicated below. Each partership
will be offered a rank-choice vote to choose areas in which they'd like to work.

#### Areas of work

Below, you'll find broad descriptions  of the various areas and their relative 
complexity. 
You may use this chart to determine which projects are of interest and 
appropriate scope.

##### `term-world` power grid

* Limited to `1` partnership

`term-world` possesses natural resources, but no systematic way to distribute 
them! While
we've seen a proof of concept for power plants, the halcyon days of everyone 
getting as
much power as they need won't last forever. To keep our world sustainable, 
someone has to
come up with a fair model. This involves any of the following (and/or more!):

- [ ] Limiting the amount of power allocated to a user's various objects
- [ ] Using power from renewable sources before accessing the limited 
exhaustible pool
- [ ] Potentially developing new resources (exhaustible and not) to feed power 
demand
- [ ] Using a limited amount of space to allocate creation of plants, panels, 
or turbines

##### `term-world` transportation

* Unlimited partnerships

`cd`ing around only gets us so far. Have you ever imagined what it would look 
like if we could,
for example, go straight from `Galbee` to `Arago`? This contemplates things like
busses, rail, or even ride sharing. However, that doesn't exist in `term-world` 
as of yet. Could
you be the one to bring these services? This might include:

- [ ] Timed, scheduled transportation opportunities and predetermined routes
- [ ] A `train-station`, `bus-station` or other project that displays schedules 
worldwide
- [ ] The ability to use these stations as a way to move between locations 
seamlessly
- [ ] On-demand transport from place to place (with a cost?)

##### `term-world` financial system

* Unlimited partnerships

The fate of partnerships rise and fall with the level of investment of time and 
resources in 
`term-world` -- the great capital cycle. Money makes the world go 'round -- of 
that we can be
sure. Of course, no capital system exists without the reward of...PROFITS!
Your task, should you take on this project is to create a market system that 
allows `term-world`
citizens to partake in the riches and risks of _investments_. This could:

- [ ] account for the value of a given partnership's rate of development to 
assess a value
- [ ] create and offer investments in many of `term-world`'s fictitious 
corporate entites
- [ ] assess a economic value of `term-world` and fix a currency to the gross 
digital product (GDP)
- [ ] contemplate a savings and loan system for residents to invest their 
hard-earned/ill-gotten gains

##### `term-world` snacks and concessions

* Unlimited partnerships

No nutritional value to be found here, folks. However, value comes in many 
shapes, sizes, and flavors!
If you accept this assignment, your task is two-fold: developing a suite of 
products that appeal to fellow
citizens _and_ creating a distribution system for them via world vending 
machines. Here you might have to:

- [ ] create a centralized list of products to stock vending machines
- [ ] draw from the above list to present options to citizens, and
- [ ] determine the quantities and availabilities of various products (e.g. 
some can sell out?)
- [ ] provide a vending machine object in every neighborhood to adequately 
promote your product
- [ ] engage in an aggressive advertising campaign

##### `term-world` inventory

* Limited to `1` partnership

`term-world` has a robust sense of property management. Despite this, there are 
certainly ways in
which it can be extended and improved. Here, you'll need to consult the current 
`inventory` system
to make improvemnets. This requires reading through a code base, but also 
working within the "rules"
and assumptions made by it. Some examples of features on request:

- [ ] `backpacks` which can increase the amount of digital "stuff" a citizen 
can carry
- [ ] mystery boxes which act like presents: users receiving the boxes don't 
know what they will get!
- [ ] the ability to propose and execute trades with other users
- [ ] improvements to inventory system commands

##### `term-world` `helper`

* Limited to `1` partnership

You didn't know it until now, but `term-world` has a new `helper` -- a robot 
that can answer Python questions
for citizens interested in deploying code to improve world services. While a 
bit limited at present, you
could be part of the partnership that makes this prototype more useful. An 
added bonus: if you work on this
project, you'll gain some experience with the elusive, controversial `GPT`. 
Some improvements:

- [ ] ability to ask `helper` for code review in the terminal
- [ ] stream the replies from the model instead of waiting for responses to 
complete
- [ ] widen the scope of examples that the `helper` can provide

##### Self-directed project

* Unlimited partnerships

If none of the above categories appeal to your partnership, you may propose an 
alternate project. To do this,
you must gain approval from Mayoral staff. It may help you to have a discussion 
with world staff in order to
develop your idea.

### Completing project work

There are various dates for documentation, demonstration, and final submission. 
Refer to the table below for these dates which are _hard deadlines_. Unless 
truly extenuating circumstances exist, these dates cannot be abridged.

|Work due              |Date                  |
|:---------------------|:---------------------|
|Proposal              |`TODO`       |
|Progress Report       |`TODO`       |
|Project Demonstration |`TODO`       |
|Final Report          |12:00p, `TODO` |
|Final Project Code    |12:00p, `TODO` |
|Final Project Presentation |`TODO`    |

#### Proposal

This project starts by writing a clear proposal of the work you expect to 
complete over the course of this extended project. This work must be completed 
in the `docs/proposal.md` file. Here, you will be expected to outline:

* the members of your partnership
* the overall concept/statement of work for the project
* a pitch for the world value of the project (i.e. why is it worth doing?)
* a breakdown of the tasks associated with the project as you perceive them now
* an assessment of the scale and schedule for the work of the project

This is similar to how you've proposed various improvements over the course of 
the semester, though somewhat extended. For example, this proposal has many 
more dimensions than a traditional improvement and, thus, has a larger expected 
word count (`500 words`). 

#### Progress Report

As the project develops, the Office of the Mayor expects progress. You will 
provide a `Progress Report` of no fewer than `500 words` which responds to 
questions in the `docs/progress.md` file. This will be accompanied by a 
demonstration 1 week later which should confirm or exceed expectations set by 
the writing in this document.

#### Project Demonstration

By the date provided above, partnerships must provide a demonstration of their 
work. This demonstration must achieve the following:

* a brief (3 minute) non-technical walkthrough presentation of how the project 
works
* a short (5 minute) technical demonstration of the project
* a necessarily long question and answer session with Mayoral representatives

#### Final Report

At the close of the work, each partnership must complete the `docs/report.md` 
file. This writing is an extended overview of the final specifications and 
instructions for the project. It must detail both the work completed and _how 
to use_ the projects that result. This report requires a minimum of `750 words`.

#### Final Project Code

Final project code has one Golden Rule and many supporting rules of lesser 
metallic lustre. Not to bury the lede, the Golden Rule:

> The project code must run and achieve its intended task.

For different projects, the form that this code takes will vary widely. However,
we can broadly say that every project will:

* contain the use of `class` files and `object`s
* appropriate use of new `method`s or `function`s
* demonstration of the broad array of skills gained throughout the semester

While these three criteria aren't concrete, they imply several specific outcomes.
The Golden Rule applies in this case, however, to say that _if the code doesn't
function, the project **is not complete**_.

For nearly every project, the code to implement a given project will exist in
another repository. It is your job to provide the link to this work in documentation
below and in the [docs/progress.md](docs/progress.md) file.

#### Final project presentation

During the time allocated to our course final exam, partnerships are expected to 
present a short (5-10 minute) talk and demonstration of the work completed. This
presentation has two parts:

* Discussion
* Demonstration

##### Discussion

Partnerships are required to create a slide deck with a link provided to a PDF
copy in the table below and link to the repository where project work was completed.

|Link type |Link         |
|:---------|:------------|
|Presentation |`TODO`       |
|Code repository|`TODO`     |

This presentation should cover:

* the value this project adds to the world
* a non-technical overview of what the project _does_
  * this might be best supported by a diagram or set of diagrams
* a summary of challenges and successes experience during completion of the project

##### Demonstration

The above presentation should also contain a demonstration which can be performed
live or as a recorded video. This demonstration constitutes _part of_ the 5 - 10
minutes required.

## Backup Policy Reminder

**While we may use this server to store code, you are responsible for using 
GitHub as your main backup.**

In the event that the `term-world` server goes down for any unforeseen reason, 
your work may be lost. Though this server is backed up on a regular (i.e. 
weekly) basis, there is no guarantee that up-to-the-minute data for your work 
will be restored.

Remember: to err is human; to back up your work is *divine*.
